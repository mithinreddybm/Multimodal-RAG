# Multimodal-RAG

This project demonstrates a Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that integrates both textual and visual data to enhance information retrieval and generation capabilities. By leveraging advanced language models and image processing techniques, the system can process and understand multimodal inputs for more comprehensive responses.

## Features

- **Multimodal Input Processing**: Handles both text and image data for retrieval and generation tasks.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Enhances response generation by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base.
- **Integration with Advanced Models**: Utilizes state-of-the-art language and vision models for processing.
- **Interactive Notebook**: Provides a Jupyter Notebook (`multimodal_rag.ipynb`) for step-by-step execution and demonstration.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mithinreddybm/Multimodal-RAG.git
   cd Multimodal-RAG
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note: Ensure that `requirements.txt` is present in the repository with all necessary dependencies listed.*

## Usage

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open and Run the Notebook**:

   - Navigate to `multimodal_rag.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface.
   - Follow the instructions and execute cells sequentially to understand and interact with the Multimodal RAG system.
